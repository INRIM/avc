Subject: ITP: python-avc -- live connection among widgets and application variables

AVC is a multiplatform, fully automatic, live connection among graphical 
interface widgets and application variables for the python language. AVC 
supports in a uniform way the most popular widget toolkits: GTK+, Qt3, 
Qt4, Tk. AVC is a python module that can be imported by any python 
application.

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are the easy way to input data to an 
application sofware and to view data produced by the application. The 
management of data exchanges between GUI and application is a central 
problem in GUI programming, it absorbs a relevant part of the 
programming effort. AVC makes the programming of this data exchanges 
very easy.

AVC 0.5.0 released 4-Feb-2008
  * Extended label widget output formatting to support generic python
    objects and to have a fallback to the standard python string
    representation (str()) when there is no formatting string or
    the formatting string is not valid.
  * New examples: a label formatting example program for each supported
    toolkit.
  * New examples: a programmatic version (GUI generated by program
    instructions) of the spin button/box/control example for each
    supported toolkit.
  * Added testing capability: activity report printout with
    selectable verbosity level.
  * Rewrited the widget abstraction layer: improved code structure,
    more compact, better separation among widget toolkit dependent code
    in AVC bindings and in AVC core code.
  * Anticipated the test for supported widget from coget creation
    (Coget.__init__()) to connections detector (_bind()): more efficient.

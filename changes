AVC 0.6.0 released 10-Jun-2008
  * Added multiple matching namespaces: the attributes of each python
    object (class instance) can be matched against any given widget tree
    or subtree, independentely from all other objects.
  * Added dynamic connections: widget-variable connections can
    be created at any run time and removed automatically at widget deletion.
  * Changed importing: now AVC detect automatically the wanted widget
    toolkit, allowing the same import statement for all toolkits.
  * Extended separation between application logic and GUI to all toolkits.
  * Updated all examples programs to use the new api.
  * Rewritten all "counter" examples to demonstrate AVC support to
    separation between application logic and GUI.
  * New examples: a countdown example for each supported toolkit to
    demonstrate multiple matching namespaces and dynamic connections.
  * Structure cleanup: removed all cross references between AVC core and
    each toolkit binding, now all references are from core to bindings.

AVC 0.5.0 released 4-Feb-2008
  * Extended label widget output formatting to support generic python
    objects and to have a fallback to the standard python string
    representation (str()) when there is no formatting string or
    the formatting string is not valid.
  * New examples: a label formatting example program for each supported
    toolkit.
  * New examples: a programmatic version (GUI generated by program
    instructions) of the spin button/box/control example for each
    supported toolkit.
  * Added testing capability: activity report printout with
    selectable verbosity level.
  * Rewrited the widget abstraction layer: improved code structure,
    more compact, better separation among widget toolkit dependent code
    in AVC bindings and in AVC core code.
  * Anticipated the test for supported widget from coget creation
    (Coget.__init__()) to connections detector (_bind()): more efficient.
